### What and why?

We propose to build a secondhand goods trading platform targeting college students specifically. College students, who often possess a limited amount of disposable income, are always circumscribed by a budget when they are adding school supplies, buying furniture, or making purchases in general. Therefore, we will establish a platform for college students to buy and sell reliable second-hand products with a budget-friendly price tag.

### For whom?

Our Secondhand Goods Trading Platform is designed exclusively for New York University(NYU) students wary of fraudulent transactions in online marketplaces. To ensure a community exclusively comprising NYU students, every account is rigorously verified by a third-party entity overseen by the platform's back office, confirming the user's affiliation with NYU. This initiative fosters a culture of responsible consumption and trust within the NYU community, providing a reliable and hassle-free trading environment.

### How?

1. Personalized User Profiles:
    - Users create profiles with their preferred pseudonym, offering them a sense of identity and privacy.
    - Users can add their contact information. 
    - Provide authentication for each student to ensure security.
    - Profiles showcase items they're selling, their ratings, and reviews from other users.

2. Item Listings:
    - Users can post items they want to sell. They provide details like a title, description, price, and optional images. This feature allows sellers to showcase their items to potential buyers.
    - Users can delete items that are already sold or they decide not to sell.

3. Advanced Search & Filters:
    - Buyers can search for specific items and use filters like category, price range, location, and seller rating.

4. Community-Driven Review & Rating System
    - Buyers can rate sellers and leave reviews; sellers can also rate buyers to ensure both parties remain accountable. 


### Scope

The project aims to create a secure, user-friendly platform for NYU students to trade secondhand goods. With features like personalized profiles, item listings, advanced search options, and a review system, the project is a multifaceted endeavor that offers enough complexity to engage a team of 5 programmers. However, it is designed to be achievable within a semester.

Responsibilities could be divided among:

- Database Management: Handling user data and listings.
- UI/UX Design: Crafting an intuitive user experience.
- Backend Development: Implementing core functionalities.
- Security: Ensuring robust verification and data protection.

The scope is challenging yet feasible, offering a rewarding experience for the team while delivering a valuable service to the NYU community. Future enhancements and extensions can be considered based on initial success.
